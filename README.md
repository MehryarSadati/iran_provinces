# iran_provinces
a very simple test from the provinces in iran.
This is a really simple game to test if you know the provinces of Iran with Python, using turtle and pandas. The idea for this program was taken from the www.sporcle.com. Since the Persian language wouldn't be written correctly in Python language and not everyone knows how to write the name of the provinces with the correct dictation in English, I used both English and Persian language in this program which you can choose at the beginning which one to go with.
